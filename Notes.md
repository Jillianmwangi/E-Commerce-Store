    DISPLAYING ADDITIONAL DATA ON HOVER
The adjacent sibling selector (+) selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.

The word "adjacent" means "immediately following", and the example above selects all elements with class=".hide", that are placed immediately after elements with class=".myDIV", on hover.
